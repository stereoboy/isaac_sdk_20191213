// Helps time synchronization of messages.
// "app-clock" starts when the application starts. Therefore "app-clock"s of two different
// applications running at the same time will potentially vary substantially. To sync messages
// between two applications, we need to resort to a common clock. Currenlty, only time_since_epoch
// is supported as the common clock, which will be the same for applications running on same device.
// More "mode"s will be added later. Currently, only Tcp communication is synchronized. To sync
// messages that are sent to or received through network, simply add a TimeSynchronizer component to
// the node(s) with TcpPublishers and TcpSubscribers. Publisher will use syncToAppTime and
// Subscriber will use appToSyncTime. Messages within an app will be in "app-clock", but messages
// over network will be in "sync-clock".
