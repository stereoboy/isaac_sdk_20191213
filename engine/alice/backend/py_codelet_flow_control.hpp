// PyCodeletFlowControl helps (C++ and Python) PyCodelet threads to synchronize.
// PyCodelet is designed to expose Python instances with corresponding functions (e.g., start(),
// tick(), and stop()) as regular C++ Codelet instance. Each C++ PyCodelet instance delegates its
// task to corresponding Python PyCodelet instance which is single-threaded.

// Interactions:
// 1) Python thread
//     i) calls pythonWaitForJob() to get a job as string. It blocks until a job is provided by C++
//        thread;
//     ii) execute the job accordingly;
//     iii) calls pythonJobFinished() to notify the C++ thread about finishing;
// 2) C++ thread
//     i) calls cppDelegateJob() to delegate a job as string to the Python instance. It blocks until
//        the Python thread notifies about finishing.
